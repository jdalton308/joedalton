  A two week promotional game app, where players spot the difference between two pictures, then submit their phone number to get a text message with a coupon for free chips and guacamole.

  This was a really fun app to build, and was designed by my coworkers at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>. For three rounds, the player is challenged to find the difference between two images, tapping or clicking on the differences and trying to find all five.

  The game was built with no JavaScript framework, and just using regular-old jQuery, as we were trying to keep it as lightweight as possible. As the game was designed to only be played in a landscape orientation, we ran into challenges with smaller phones, like the iPhone4. This led to the layout being a little different on very small phones, but also led me to make the game accessible as a <a href="//developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/">progressive web app</a>.  So if a player was on their phone, and they saved the page to their homescreen, like a bookmark, it would launch with an experience similar to a native app.  I am not sure how many users actually used this, but it did provide the best experience in the game, and worked on both iPhones and Android.
