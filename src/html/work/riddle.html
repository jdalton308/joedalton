<h3 class="sub-title">
	A five-day promotion that gave a free bowl of food in return for guessing a riddle correctly.
</h3>

<p>
	This was a pretty simple app, but was fun to build, and was excellently designed by my coworkers at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>.  The user would get three guesses at the riddle, then would get to enter their phone number and email to recieve a coupon for a free bowl of food.  The promotion ran for five days, with a new riddle each day.
</p>
<p>
	The game was built with the AngularJS framework.  Interesting pieces included how the JavaScript determined the day, then would populate the language throughout the game accordingly, and working with a third-party API for the coupons.  I think we could have done some more animations and made the game a little more visually fun, but it was short time-frame, was well recieved, everyone was happy the way it turned out.
