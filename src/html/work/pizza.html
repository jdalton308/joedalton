  A site that I was able to build from scratch, it leveraged some parallax scrolling effects, some unique Google Maps styling, and also integrated with a custom CMS built on Ruby on Rails.
</h3>

<p>
  Again designed by my coworkers at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>, this was a really fun product to build.  The designer had some very specific ideas about how the scrolling experience should be on the homepage, and their Menu page. This was my first time implementing the parallax effect, and turned out to be pretty fun.  There is also the locations page, which interacts with the Google Maps API, and allowed me to create some specific styles for the map, which was also a first for me.

  One of my favorite features turned out to be the navigation menu, which takes over the page on desktop and mobile. The designer and I came up with a step-wise way to show the nav and then fade-in the text, which creats a simple but nice experience. Another unique design was their Inspiration page, which had a request to scale proportionately with the window size, rather than use breakpoints. To do this, everything on the page is sized relative to the screen's height and width, and I am pretty happy with the outcome.

<p>
  All-in-all, this is one of my favorite projects so far, mainly because of the design aspects. ...also, who doesn't like pizza?
