	Working with Viscira's in-house team, created the front-end of their website.
</h3>

<p>
	Viscira is a unique agency in San Francisco, focusing their talents on the biotech and pharmacautical industries.  They are very successful in navigating this complicated and highly regulated area, and regularly roll-out impressive websites themselves, as well as amazing motion graphics, 3D-animation, video, and graphic designs.  They are a full-service agency that just needed a hand with their personal site.
</p>
<p>
	Their designs were all created in-house, as well the back-end and CMS set-up for the site.  Interesting challenges included working with the Joomla CMS and using multiple grid layouts.
