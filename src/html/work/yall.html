  An editorial site featuring the stories of creative professionals who have moved from the southern US up to New York City.
</h3>

<p>
  This is a site built for a friend in support of his passion project: Yall Collective. This friend, who also is from the South, felt that other people who had migrated to New York had some not only interesting, but inspirational stories to tell about thier journey.  So, this site features profiles, Q&amp;A's, and essays about these people.
</p>
<p>
  The site was designed by this friend, then built in two stages. Since the site was planned to be built as a Wordpress theme, but had a desired launch date quicker than the theme could be finished, we had to a 'soft' launch of a static site, then a few weeks later launch the full-featured Wordpress site after the theme was finished.
</p>
<p>
  This was a really fun project, and the first Wordpress theme I developed from scratch. Most of the interesting development aspects surrounded giving the writer of the posts the control to create many different layout options.  In the end, my friend and I both are happy with the site.
