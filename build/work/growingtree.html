<h3 class="work-type">PRINT</h3><h1 class="title">The Growing Tree School</h1><h3 class="sub-title">Promotional pieces to help launch their new location</h3><p>The Growing Tree School is a preschool and day-care center with two locations in San Francisco. A relationship that started as just some small website updates and troubleshooting evolved into these design projects. Their second location was just about to open, so they wanted a 10-foot banner to hang outside, as well as some brochures and flyers to hand out during their open houses. We were all pretty happy with how they turned out.</p><h3 class="sub-title">Banner</h3><div class="featured-image"><img src="/img/work/growingtree/banner.jpg" alt="Enrolling Now banner for The Growing Tree School"></div><h3 class="sub-title">Brochure</h3><div class="featured-image two-img"><img src="/img/work/growingtree/brochure_page_1-opt.jpg" alt="Front of The Growing Tree School brochure"> <img src="/img/work/growingtree/brochure_page_2-opt.jpg" alt="Back of The Growing Tree School brochure"></div><h3 class="sub-title">Flyer</h3><div class="featured-image"><img src="/img/work/growingtree/flyer-opt.jpg" alt="Promotional flyer for The Growing Tree Schools newest location"></div>
