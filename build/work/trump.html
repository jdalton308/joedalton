My very talented friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theko" target="_blank">Ko</a> came up with most of the designs, and together we figured out the interaction and user experience. Mostly, we just tried to keep the page as simple as possible, but also incorporate a live, global trip-counter and let people share the page on social media.</p><p>Technically, the site sits on Google's Firebase platform, which uses web sockets to make the trip-counter into a live scoreboard. There is very little JavaScript on the page, and the whole mobile experience of turning the phone and having Mr. Trump fall over is driven by just CSS. So, techincally the site is pretty simple as well.</p><p><a href="//trump.betripping.com" target="_blank" class="button orange">Visit Trump.BeTripping</a></p>
