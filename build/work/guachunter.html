<h3 class="work-type">WEB APP</h3><h1 class="title">Chipotle's Guac Hunter</h1><h3 class="sub-title">A two week promotional game app, where players spot the difference between two pictures, then submit their phone number to get a text message with a coupon for free chips and guacamole.</h3><p>This was a really fun app to build, and was designed by my coworkers at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>. For three rounds, the player is challenged to find the difference between two images, tapping or clicking on the differences and trying to find all five.</p><p>The game was built with no JavaScript framework, and just using regular-old jQuery, as we were trying to keep it as lightweight as possible. As the game was designed to only be played in a landscape orientation, we ran into challenges with smaller phones, like the iPhone4. This led to the layout being a little different on very small phones, but also led me to make the game accessible as a <a href="//developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/">progressive web app</a>. So if a player was on their phone, and they saved the page to their homescreen, like a bookmark, it would launch with an experience similar to a native app. I am not sure how many users actually used this, but it did provide the best experience in the game, and worked on both iPhones and Android.</p><p><a href="//www.guachunter.com" target="_blank" class="button orange">Play Guac Hunter</a></p>
