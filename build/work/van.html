I designed and planned the entire site, which was the most fun part. The basic direction was to be fun, bold, and give the impression of depth. As expected, the site is completely responsive, and uses analytics and open-graph tags.</p><p>The biggest challenge of the site, for me, was building the web server on Node.js. This was my first project with Node, and my first project where I built the server, so I had to learn a bit. First I built the server using just the Node API, then switched to using the Express framework. The site sits on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance, and uses the node module <a href="//www.npmjs.com/package/pm2" target="_blank">pm2</a> to run continually. Aside from the Node server, the only unique aspects of the site are the HTML art on the landing screen and the integration with the Instagram API. The blog also uses Amazon advertisements, but that was a very non-technical integration.</p><p>I am pretty excited to have the site up, although I have been a little slow to post the articles I planned to write. If you visit, click the landing image to add more birds. Enjoy.</p><p><a href="//www.joeplusvan.com" target="_blank" class="button orange">Visit JoePlusVan.com</a></p>
