  Chevron Techron

<h3 class="sub-title">
  A fun single-page site (plus a contact page), to promote the Techron product, involving lots of videos and a custom image "slider".

  Again designed by my coworkers at <a href="http://www.sequence.com" target="_blank">Sequence</a>, this was a project that started as just a prototype to deliver with the designs, but Chevron was so satisfied with it that they asked us to produce the production site as well, which was pretty much just the prototype with the correct links created.

  There were three challenges with the site: Getting the video experiences to work across all devices; Using the browser's geolocation API to direct a button to a specific, regoinal, station-finder URL (which they ended up taking out); And allowing each individual video to be shared to social media, independent from the site.  While this was a simple site to build, these features made it a more fun experience, along with the little animations that they gave me some room to run with.
