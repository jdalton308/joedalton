	A stand-alone but full-featured client-side app built with AngularJS
</h3>

<p>
	This project was a lot of fun, and was done at the agency where I work, <a href="http://www.sequence.com">Sequence</a>. The design was done by a couple of our great designers, then I got to build out as much of the app as I could in about two weeks.
</p>
<p>
	The app is designed to allow patients and their doctors to communicate easier by allowing users (either doctors or patients) to create profiles and their own network.  In this prototype, I created both a doctor's view and a patient's view, with each profile being fully editable.
</p>
<p>
	One of my favorite pieces, which was probably the most challenges, was the animations that overlay the login screen's video. This was done completely with CSS, utilizing some looping Sass functions. Other fun parts were making almost all the information editable, creating sliders and percentage bars from HTML, and a lot of little animations throughout the app that made it feel a bit more refined.
